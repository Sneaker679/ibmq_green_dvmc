## Installation
This is a Python code. Use the latest version of language as of 15/06/2023 to avoid issues.
To run this code, you will need to install the following packages for your Python. The links to their documentation is also provided :
- qiskit-->  (https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html)
- qcm-->  (https://qcm-wed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation)

Note that the "qcm" package is not manditory as its only purpose is to benchmark the calculations using the quantum computer.

Also note that in its current form, the "qcm" package needs a custom modification so it can work with the current code. In the "qcm" package, locate `pyqcm/_spectral.py` and find in it the "*cluster_spectral_function*" function. Remove the hashtags preceding the "*return*" at the end. You will need to rebuild the package and perform all the installation steps again, as described by the documentation.

## Description
This code is meant to calculate the Green Function for a specified system of low amount of sites. Instead of calculating it using conventional binary based computers, we simulate the calculation on a quantum computer using the qiskit package. 

The code itself is accompanied by a few supplementary benchmarks codes. These benchmark codes come in two types : benchmarks that use a custom second quantization base implementation, and benchmarks that use the "qcm" package. All the codes related to this custom second quantization base implementation are located in the *second_quantization_codes/* directory, while those from the "qcm" package are located in `quantum_computer_codes/...` and its subsequent directories. This is because the quantum computer is directly benchmarked with "qcm".

## Usage
The primary use of this code is to calculate the Green Function. I will walktrough you into using the included preset for a 2 sites system. The general idea is the same for other sites. Note that the usage of the second quantization benchmarks will not be explained.

### How it works
All the files located in `quantum_computer_codes/2sites/` are useful to the calculation of the Green Function for 2 sites systems. Here is the uses of each individual files:

---
- The `parameters.py` file is where you can modify the parameters and variables to be used by all the files in the folder. It is also where you need to modify your lattice structures and circuit configurations if you are opting for a customized model. Specifications on the inner workings of the lattice and circuit objects are located in the "qiskit" package documentation.
- The `generate.py` is meant to generate the specified matrices, print them in the CMD and save them as `.npy` files.
- The `graph.py` file will use the `.npy` files and the ground state energy generated by `gs.py` to calculate the Green Function and make a graph with it. Said graph will be called `ibmq_spectrum.pdf`. This file also generates a ```local_dos.dat``` file.
- The `generate_graph.py` file will run `generate.py` and then `graph.py` for an easy usage of the code. Note that those last two files can be ran independantly with no problems.

---

- The `qcm_benchmark.py`, similarly to `graph.py`, will generate a graph of the Green Function using the "qcm" package. Said graph will be called `qcm_spectrum.pdf`. The file also generates a ```local_dos_qcm.dat``` file. 

---

- The `combined_graphs.py` file, using the two `.dat` files in the directory, generates a combined graph of the Green Function calculated by both methods (ibmq and qcm). This is meant to directly compare these methods.

---

- The `excitation2sites.def` is the file containing all the excitation types of the system. If this file is to be changed, it needs to respect the exact formatting of the current files.

---
### Execution
For a basic utilisation of the code, first go in this subdirectory : `quantum_computer_codes/...`. From there, directories should already be there for a few specific systems. These directories will be named like this : (# of sites)sites/. Enter one of them, then open the `parameters.py` file. Modify the parameters and variables as you see fit, then save the file and run the `generate_graph.py` code. Wait for the calculation to end. Finally, open the `ibmq_spectrum.pdf` for the result.

### Custom systems
***This section is unfinished.
To create and calculate the green function for custom systems, you will need to copy one of the examples and modify the following files to your needs :
- `parameters.py` : change N and N_min. All other parameters are up to you. If N is a prime number, you will need to input a custom lattice in parameters. Find the portion of the code where you can input your circuit.
- `qcm_benchmark.py` : Make sure the proper bloc is targeted in the line that contains the following string :  R0:N{N}:S0.
- `excitation.def` : Make sure the excitation types there match the number of sites and the number of excitations. The number of excitations is calculated using the following formula : N_exc = 2 + N_min ( N_min + 1 ).

## TODO
- Benchmarking of the quantum computer using the second quantization codes and its newly implemented "t" hopping matrix. Initial results are somewhat weird, needs further testing with 4 sites systems.
- Add a code to generate excitation.def files automatically.
- Optimisation
