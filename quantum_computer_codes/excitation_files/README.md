There are multiple configurations of excitations for a single system in this folder. Since the `graph.py` code filters some of these excitations at the end of the process, we can remove some excitations before the process so calculation time is greatly reduced. Hence the numerous excitation files for a single system. Be aware that these files may only work at particular values of mu.
